# DevOps Lab 2 - Git Basics (SSH Key Setup Using ED25519 and Cloning a Repository)

## 1. Generate a New SSH Key

Run the following command:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- `-t ed25519`: Uses the modern **ED25519** algorithm (more secure and faster than RSA).
- `-C "your_email@example.com"`: Adds a label for identification.

When prompted:
- Press **Enter** to accept the default save location:
```bash
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/your_user/.ssh/id_ed25519):
```
- If asked for a passphrase, you can enter one (recommended) or leave it empty.

## 2. Start the SSH Agent

Ensure the SSH agent is running:
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```
You should see output like:
```bash
Agent pid 12345
```

---

## 3. Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent

Now, add your key to the SSH agent:
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
You should see:
```bash
Identity added: /home/your_user/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

---

## 4. Copy the SSH Key

To copy your public key (used for authentication), run:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
It will output something like:
```bash
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nza... your_email@example.com
```
Copy this entire line.

## 5. Add SSH Key to GitHub

### **For GitHub:**
1. Go to **GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys**.
2. Click **New SSH key**.
3. Paste the copied key.
4. Click **Add SSH key**.
5. Confirm with your GitHub password or 2FA.

---

## 6. Test SSH Connection

To verify if SSH authentication is working, run:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
If successful, you'll see:
```bash
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

---

## 7. Clone a Repository Using SSH

Now that SSH is set up, use SSH instead of HTTP to clone repositories:

### **For GitHub:**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
```

## 8. Push to a Remote Repository

Navigate to your project directory:
```bash
cd my-project
```

Initialize Git (if not already done):
```bash
git init
```

Add the remote origin using SSH:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
```

Add and commit your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Push changes to GitHub:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
