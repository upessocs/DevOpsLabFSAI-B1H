# GIT BASICS

## Using SSH and HTTP for Git

### SSH Key Setup

SSH allows for secure authentication when working with Git repositories. Below are the steps to configure SSH keys.

#### 1. Generating an SSH Key
Run the following command to create an SSH key:
```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Check if the key has been created by listing the `.ssh` directory:
```sh
ls ~/.ssh
```

#### 2. Viewing the SSH Key
To display the public key, use:
```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

#### 3. Adding SSH Key to SSH-Agent
Ensure the SSH agent is running and add your key:
```sh
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

#### 4. Linking the SSH Key to GitHub
- Open **GitHub Settings** → **SSH and GPG keys** → **Add a new key**
- Copy the content of `id_ed25519.pub` and paste it into GitHub

### Cloning a Repository via SSH
```sh
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
```

---

### Cloning a Repository via HTTP
```sh
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```
If authentication is required, Git will prompt you for your credentials.

## Git Workflow

### 1. Initialize and Clone Repository
```sh
git init
git clone <repository-url>
```

### 2. Working with a Repository
1. Navigate to the repository directory.
2. Make necessary changes.
3. Stage the changes:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
4. Commit changes with a message:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

### 3. Handling Merge Conflicts
If working from multiple locations, always pull before pushing:
```sh
git pull origin main
git merge
```
Then, push the changes:
```sh
git push origin main
```
