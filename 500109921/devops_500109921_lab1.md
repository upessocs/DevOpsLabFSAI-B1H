# DevOps Lab 1: Introduction to CI/CD

## Overview
Git is a powerful distributed version control system that enables developers to efficiently track and manage changes in their code. GitHub extends Git by providing a cloud-based hosting platform with enhanced collaboration tools.

## Understanding Git Workflow
1. **Local Repository**: Developers keep a local copy of the project on their machine.
2. **Staging Area**: Modified files are added to the staging area before committing.
3. **Commits**: A commit saves a snapshot of the staged changes in the local repository.
4. **Remote Repository**: The local repository can be synchronized with a GitHub-hosted repository.
5. **Collaboration**: Developers work together using branches, pull requests, and merges.

## Lab 1: Basic Linux and Git Commands

### Installing WSL and NixOS

#### 1. Install Ubuntu using WSL
To install Ubuntu using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), run the following command in PowerShell:

```sh
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

#### 2. Install NixOS in Single-User Mode
For a NixOS single-user installation, follow the official documentation for proper setup.

### Using Git Bash
Git Bash provides a Linux-like terminal experience on Windows, enabling the use of standard Linux commands.

#### Common Linux Commands in Git Bash

- **ls** → Lists files and directories.
- **pwd** → Prints the current working directory.
- **cd Desktop** → Changes the directory to the Desktop.

## Essential Git Commands

### 1. Configure Git
```sh
# Set global username and email
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### 2. Initialize a Git Repository
```sh
# Create a new Git repository in the current directory
git init
```

### 3. Clone a Repository
```sh
# Copy an existing repository from GitHub
git clone "https://github.com/yourrepository.git"
```

### 4. Check the Repository Status
```sh
git status
```

### 5. View Remote Repositories
```sh
git remote -v
```

### 6. View Branches
```sh
git branch
```

### 7. Check Commit History
```sh
git log
```

### 8. View Differences Between Commits
```sh
git diff
```

### 9. Stage Files for Commit
```sh
# Add a specific file
git add filename
```

### 10. Commit Changes
```sh
# Save staged changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### 11. Push Changes to Remote Repository
```sh
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### 12. Pull Updates from Remote Repository
```sh
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

### 13. Create a New Branch
```sh
git branch <new-branch-name>
```

### 14. Switch to a Different Branch
```sh
git checkout <branch-name>
```

### 15. Merge Branches
```sh
# Merge another branch into the current branch
git merge <branch-name>
```

### 16. Submit a Pull Request on GitHub
1. Push your changes to the remote repository.
2. Open your repository on GitHub.
3. Click **Compare & pull request**.
4. Add a description and click **Create pull request**.

## Creating Files and Directories

To create files for different purposes:

```sh
touch home
```
```sh
touch office
```

These commands create empty files named `home` and `office` in the current directory.

✅ **Your repository is now set up for team collaboration!**
